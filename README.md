**178 Hotspot zones for field observation visit**
As part of the post-disaster response activity by The Spirit of Brotherhood Mission (TSBM), its sister organization (GSM) attempted to conduct field observation at most affected areas. I provided technical support to identify 246 priority zones for field observation using damage proxy map from Remote Sensing Lab at Earth Observatory Singapore (EOS-RS).
